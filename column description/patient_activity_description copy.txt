activity.score
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Activity score provides an estimate how well recent physical activity has matched ring user's needs. It is calculated as a weighted average of activity score contributors that represent one aspect of suitability of the activity each. The contributor values are also available as separate parameters.

activity.score_stay_active
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates how well the ring user has managed to avoid of inactivity (sitting or standing still) during last 24 hours. The more inactivity, the lower contributor value.

The contributor value is 100 when inactive time during past 24 hours is below 5 hours. The contributor value is above 95 when inactive time during past 24 hours is below 7 hours.

The weight of activity.score_stay_active in activity score calculation is 0.15.

activity.score_move_every_hour
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates how well the ring user has managed to avoid long periods of inactivity (sitting or standing still) during last 24 hours. The contributor includes number of continuous inactive periods of 60 minutes or more (excluding sleeping). The more long inactive periods, the lower contributor value.

The contributor value is 100 when no continuous inactive periods of 60 minutes or more have been registered. The contributor value is above 95 when at most one continuous inactive period of 60 minutes or more has been registered.

The weight of activity.score_move_every_hour in activity score calculation is 0.10.

activity.score_meet_daily_targets
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates how often the ring user has reached his/her daily activity target during seven last days (100 = six or seven times, 95 = five times).

The weight of activity.score_meet_daily_targets in activity score calculation is 0.25.

activity.score_training_frequency
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates how regularly the ring user has had physical exercise the ring user has got during last seven days.

The contributor value is 100 when the user has got more than 100 minutes of medium or high intensity activity on at least four days during past seven days. The contributor value is 95 when the user has got more than 100 minutes of medium or high intensity activity on at least three days during past seven days.

The weight of activity.score_training_frequency in activity score calculation is 0.10.

activity.score_training_volume
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates how much physical exercise the ring user has got during last seven days.

The contributor value is 100 when thes sum of weekly MET minutes is over 2000. The contributor value is 95 when the sum of weekly MET minutes is over 750. There is a weighting function so that the effect of each day gradually disappears.

The weight of activity.score_training_volume in activity score calculation is 0.15.

activity.score_recovery_time
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
This activity score contributor indicates if the user has got enough recovery time during last seven days.

The contributor value is 100 when: 1. The user has got at least two recovery days during past 7 days. 2. No more than two days elapsed after the latest recovery day.

The contributor value is 95 when: 1. The user has got at least one recovery day during past 7 days. 2. No more than three days elapsed after the latest recovery day.

Here a day is considered as a recovery day when amount of high intensity activity did not exceed 100 MET minutes and amount of medium intensity activity did not exceed 200 MET minutes. The exact limits will be age and gender dependent.

The weight of activity.score_recovery_time in activity score calculation is 0.25.

activity.daily_movement

Unit: meters
Daily physical activity as equal meters i.e. amount of walking needed to get the same amount of activity.

activity.non_wear
Type: Int

activity.rest
Type: Int
Unit: minutes
Number of minutes during the day spent resting i.e. sleeping or lying down (average MET level of the minute is below 1.05).
