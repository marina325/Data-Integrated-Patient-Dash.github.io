sleep.summary_date
Type: String
Format: YYYY-MM-DD
One day prior to the date when the sleep period ended. Note: this is one day before the date that is shown in the apps.

sleep.period_id
Type: Int
Index of the sleep period among sleep periods with the same summary_date, where 0 = first sleep period of the day.

sleep.timezone
Type: Int
Unit: Minutes
Timezone offset from UTC as minutes. For example, EEST (Eastern European Summer Time, +3h) is 180. PST (Pacific Standard Time, -8h) is -480. Note that timezone information is also available in the datetime values themselves, see for example.bedtime_start

sleep.bedtime_start
Type: String
Format: Date time
Local time when the sleep period started

sleep.bedtime_end
Type: String
Format: Date time
Local time when the sleep period ended.

sleep.duration
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total duration of the sleep period (sleep.duration = sleep.bedtime_end - sleep.bedtime_start).

sleep.total
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total amount of sleep registered during the sleep period (sleep.total = sleep.rem + sleep.light + sleep.deep).

sleep.awake
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total amount of awake time registered during the sleep period.

sleep.rem
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total amount of REM sleep registered during the sleep period.

sleep.light
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total amount of light (N1 or N2) sleep registered during the sleep period.

sleep.deep
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Total amount of deep (N3) sleep registered during the sleep period.

sleep.hr_lowest
Type: Int
Unit: beats per minute
The lowest heart rate (5 minutes sliding average) registered during the sleep period.

sleep.hr_average
Type: Int
Unit: beats per minute
The average heart rate registered during the sleep period.

sleep.hr_5min
Type: Array of integers
Unit: beats per minute
Average heart rate for each beginning 5 minutes of the sleep period, the first period starting from sleep.bedtime_start.

sleep.efficiency
Type: Int
Range: 0-100%
Sleep efficiency is the percentage of the sleep period spent asleep (100% * sleep.total / sleep.duration).

sleep.onset_latency
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
Detected latency from bedtime_start to the beginning of the first five minutes of persistent sleep.

sleep.midpoint_time
Type: Int
Unit: seconds
The time in seconds from the start of sleep to the midpoint of sleep. The midpoint ignores awake periods.

sleep.restless
Type: Integer
Unit: %
Restlessness of the sleep time, i.e. percentage of sleep time when the user was moving.

sleep.temperature_delta
Type: Float
Unit: Celsius
Skin temperature deviation from the long-term temperature average.

sleep.breath_average
Type: Float
Unit: breaths per minute
Average respiratory rate.

sleep.score
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Sleep score represents overall sleep quality during the sleep period. It is calculated as a weighted average of sleep score contributors that represent one aspect of sleep quality each. The sleep score contributor values are also available as separate parameters.

sleep.score_total
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents total sleep time's (see sleep.total) contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_rem
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents REM sleep time's (see sleep.rem) contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_deep
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents deep (N3) sleep time's (see sleep.deep) contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_efficiency
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents sleep efficiency's (see sleep.efficiency) contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_latency
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents sleep onset latency's (see sleep.onset_latency) contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_disturbances
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents sleep disturbances' contribution for sleep quality.

sleep.score_alignment
Type: Int
Range: 1-100, or 0 if not available.
Represents circadian alignment's contribution for sleep score.

sleep.hypnogram_5min
Type: String
A string that contains one character for each starting five minutes of the sleep period, so that the first period starts from sleep.bedtime.start: - '1' = deep (N3) sleep - '2' = light (N1 or N2) sleep - '3' = REM sleep - '4' = awake

sleep.rmssd
Type: Int
Unit: milliseconds
The average HRV calculated with rMSSD method.

sleep.rmssd_5min
Type: Array of integers
Unit: milliseconds
The average HRV (calculated using rMSSD method) for each beginning 5 minutes of the sleep period, the first period starting from sleep.bedtime_start.
