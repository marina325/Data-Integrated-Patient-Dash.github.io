# Medical Dashboarding - Quarter 2 Project

Bioengineering Students' GitHub
<br> Website link: https://data-integrated-patient-dash.github.io/

This is the section that Data Visualization will handle. 

## Current Plans
- Add a section where you are able to select any two (different) variables and subject them to analysis.<br>
- Add data querying sections in order to visualize specific time frames.


## Downloading and Running This Code (currently, *needs changing*)
In order to properly run this code, you must copy this repository into a local machine, and then change to the dashboard website directory. <br>Once you've changed into the correct directory (It will be named something similar to "Data-Integrated-Patient-Dash.github.io/dashboard-website").

 *** All code snippets are contained within single quotes, for instance: 'example code' ***
### Pip
Pip is necessary to download dependencies:<br>
<br>Windows:<br> 
  First, run this command first: 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py'
  <br>Then run this command: 'python get-pip.py'<br>
<br>MacOS:<br> 
  run this command: 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3'

### NodeJS
If NodeJS is not currently in your local system run the following command: 'pip install nodejs' (replace pip with pip3 for macOS)<br> 
NodeJS is required to run required javascript files.<br>

To install all required dependencies, run: 'npm install'


### Testing the Code
Once everything is installed we can run 'yarn start' in order to run the dashboard with the patient data we currently have.
