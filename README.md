# Medical Dashboarding - Quarter 2 Project

Bioengineering Students' GitHub
<br> Website link: https://data-integrated-patient-dash.github.io/

This is the section that Data Visualization will handle. 

## Current Plans
We plan to add a section where you are able to select any two (different) variables and subject them to analysis.
We plan to add data querying sections in order to visualize specific time frames.

### Downloading and Running This Code
In order to properly run this code, you must copy this repository into a local machine. Once you've changed into the correct directory (something like "Data-Integrated-Patient-Dash.github.io"), we run pip install -r requirements.txt in order to install the correct dependencies. 

### Testing the Code
Once everything is installed we can run 'python run.py test' in order to run the dashboard with test data we currently have.
