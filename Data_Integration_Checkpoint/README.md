# DSC180A-Checkpoint-A03-Data_Integration

Patients and healthcare providers have expressed a pressing need for a comprehensive platform that serves as a one-stop solution for efficiently navigating health statistics gathered from diverse sources. This platform would significantly enhance the accuracy of clinical diagnoses and the long-term management of patient health. Specifically, clinicians require a more streamlined method to sift through health data, extending beyond electronic health records like EPIC, to encompass sources such as Apple Health and Oura Ring data. Past year data science and bioengineering groups have focused on the problem and built dashboards called Med Dash as a platform for patients to visualize their data. <br><br>
In this yearâ€™s project, we are aiming on:<br>
<li>Integrating data from patient calendars, personal life events and electronic health records. 
<li>Develop advanced and informative visualization for patients and healthcare professionals based on what the Med-Dash already had. 
<li>Implement Vital API for getting patients data from different electronic devices. 
Calculating and analyzing patients data from API.
